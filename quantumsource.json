The ethos of the app is to merge the technologies of today with a pixel-perfect recreation of the user experience of the past. The vast majority of apps in OldOS are fully functional — meaning they seamlessly integrate with the data on your phone to deliver a live, emulator-esque experience. What does this mean? Well, you can play your music in iPod, get directions in Maps, surf the web in Safari, view the current weather in Weather, and much more. By the same token, no shortcuts were taken in fully fleshing out the operating system. You can change your background, adjust settings, search apps, et cetera. There are a few apps still not ready for primetime but don't worry, they're coming soon.\n\nWith OldOS, you no longer need to worry about securing a legacy iPhone to experience nostalgia — it's available on your daily driver.\n\nPart of the goal with OldOS is to enable anyone to understand how iOS works and demonstrate just how powerful SwiftUI truly is. For that reason, the entire app is open-sourced — enabling developers to learn about, modify, and add to the app. I thought building this over my last six or so months in high school and sharing it with the world would be a fun and productive endeavor.\n\nSpecial Features:\n* 🧑‍💻 Built almost entirely using SwiftUI.\n* 🎨 Designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible.\n* 📱 Fully functional, perhaps even usable as a second OS.\n* ❤️ A testament to the work of Apple employees of both the past and the present.\n* 🗺️ Fully open source for all to learn, modify, and build on.","iconURL":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project/master/OldOS/OldOS/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/1024.png","tintColor":"#181818","size":88173533,"screenshotURLs":["https://github.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project/raw/master/Images/Market_1.jpg","https://github.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project/raw/master/Images/Market_2.jpg","https://github.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project/raw/master/Images/Market_3.jpg","https://github.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project/raw/master/Images/Market_4.jpg","https://github.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project/raw/master/Images/Market_5.jpg"]},{"name":"unc0ver","bundleIdentifier":"science.xnu.undecimus","developerName":"Pwn20wnd","subtitle":"The most advanced jailbreak tool.","version":"8.0.2","versionDate":"2021-12-29T21:35:42Z","versionDescription":"# v8.0.2 Release\n\n- Add exploit guidance to improve reliability on A12-A13 iPhones running iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n- Fix exploit reliability on iPhone XS devices running iOS 14.6-14.8","downloadURL":"https://unc0ver.dev/downloads/8.0.2/9e44edfbfd1905cadf23c3b9ad1d5bed683ce061/unc0ver_Release_8.0.2.ipa","localizedDescription":"unc0ver is an advanced jailbreaking tool for iOS devices.

Unfortunately, there has been no easy way for people to play these games whenever they so desired...that is, until now. GBA4iOS was made for one purpose and one purpose only: to help everyone relive their favorite games from their past. Now, every where you take your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, you can bring and play your classic games with you, giving you practically endless hours of entertainment!\n\nSo that's great and all, but what features does GBA4iOS actually have? Far too many to list in one App Store description, but here are some of the biggest:\n\n• Multiplayer (iPhone 5 or newer, iPad 4 or newer). GBA4iOS allows you to link with other players nearby and play with them, allowing you to unlock or experience certain events in games that are unavailable to just one player! Plus, nothing is cooler than playing games with your friends.\n\n• Save States. Ever get frustrated when a game requires you to save only at certain points? Well be frustrated no longer, GBA4iOS fully supports Save States, allowing you to save anywhere in the game and resume right from that point later. Even better, you can protect certain save states so you never accidentally overwrite them (and as everyone knows losing game data is one of the worst things in the world).\n\n• Cheat Codes. Sometimes games are just too hard, and you need a little boost to help defeat it. GBA4iOS allows you to input and use GameShark, Action Replay, Code Breaker, and Game Genie codes as you see fit. Don't worry, we won't judge!\n\n• Fast Forward (iPhone 4s or newer, iPad 2 or newer, iPod Touch 5th Gen). Don't you wish there was a way to speed up long cutscenes in games, or to reduce the time doing boring tasks in the game? Well, now there is! GBA4iOS allows you to \"Fast Forward\" through slow parts of the game, allowing you to get back to the fun even quicker.\n\n• Customizable Controller Skins. Want to change the look of the controller to something more personal? No worries, you can download a multitude of new controller skins from within the app, or download almost countless more from the web! You'll definitely be able to find a controller skin you like.\n\n• Dropbox Sync. Have multiple devices, or worried something will happen to your games? Dropbox Sync solves both these issues! When enabled, GBA4iOS will sync your game saves, save states, and cheat codes to Dropbox, keeping any and all your devices up to date with your latest changes. Plus, this means your game data is always backed up in the cloud, so if something happens to your device, your data is safe.\n\n• MFi Controller Support. Sometimes, touchscreen buttons just aren't good enough for the level of precision needed by some games. Luckily, GBA4iOS supports MFi Controllers, allowing you to connect and use physical controllers with your games! Now you can beat that final boss without a sweat.\n\nAll this and more ensures that GBA4iOS will give you the best portable gaming experience, hands down. So what are you waiting for, download GBA4iOS now and enjoy reliving your favorite classic games immediately!","iconURL":"https://i.imgur.com/SBrqO9g.png","tintColor":"78209d","size":7924507,"screenshotURLs":["https://i.imgur.com/L4H0yM3.png","https://i.imgur.com/UPGYLVr.png","https://i.imgur.com/sWpUAii.png","https://i.imgur.com/UwnDXRc.png"]},{"name":"RetroArch","bundleIdentifier":"com.libretro.RetroArchiOS11","developerName":"libretro","subtitle":"Cross-platform, sophisticated frontend for emulation.","version":"1.12.0","versionDate":"2022-10-17","versionDescription":"Many bug fixes and quality of life improvements.

To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289).

Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating.

To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU → QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting.
